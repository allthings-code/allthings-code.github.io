"Life is not a matter of holding good cards, but of playing a poor hand well." - Robert Louis Stevenson

# Introduction
If you're thinking "Wait a minute, this is a programming blog and not a gothic Scottish novel about a shapeshifting doctor?! What gives?" then stop right there!
Jekyll (the tool, not the doctor) is quite similar to its' namesake - but rather than turn into a serial murderer - Jekyll turns generic markdown files into a static website. It allows you to serve user content quickly and easily.

# Background
Written in [Ruby]: https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/documentation/ by [Tom Preston-Werner]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Preston-Werner in the year 2008, Jekyll was a pioneer in the space of [static web pages]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Static_web_page. Tom Preston-Werner went on later in his career to cofound [Github]: https://github.com/ where Jekyll was slated as the engine behind [Github Pages]: https://pages.github.com/. Now Jekyll is the most widely adopted static web page generator.

# Jekyll's Secret Serum
So how exactly does Jekyll work? It's quite simple really. First, Jekyll composes all files within the _posts directory as post objects. What's the _posts directory you ask? We will get to that. Then Jekyll composes all files withn the _site directory as layout objects.

Then, Jekyll creates one giant ruby object by combining these composed posts/layouts with site metadata (dates, titles, links, etc).

Jekyll then uses a language called [Liquid]: https://shopify.github.io/liquid/ to liquify all posts and layouts.

Finally, these liquified templates and posts are rendered.

#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
